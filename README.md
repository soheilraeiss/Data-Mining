# Data-Mining
Data Preprocessing Techniques in Data Mining Using IBM SPSS and Python 
The project was conducted in two parts. The first part is dedicated to significant data preprocessing techniques in data mining. It involves handling missing data, detecting outliers, and data normalization, all of which are crucial in preparing datasets for analysis. This little exercise gives you a visual idea of how real-world data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. And also apply hands-on experience in data cleaning and manipulating data sets with IBM SPSS and Python.

In the second section, we explore some of the main data mining algorithms and how they are applied to the Boston Housing Dataset.
